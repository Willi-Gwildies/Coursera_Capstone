    "- The the district Neukölln in Berlin, Germany is relativly big with 166.157 residents. There are some upcoming neighborhood which are packed with restaurants, night life and hip people. For people that are new to Neukölln it can be hard to figure out what restaurants are worth going to and where they are. For people that used to live in Neukölln or are visiting, how do they know what's the best places to get some good food or drinks?\n",

    "**Business Problem:**\n",
    "- For this project, I am going to create a simple guide on where to eat based on Foursquare ratings, price, category and geographic location data for restaurants in Neukölln. I will then cluster these restaurants based on their similarities so that a user can easily check out what kind of food they are looking for and in what price range.    "
